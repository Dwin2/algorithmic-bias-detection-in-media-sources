Why it made sense to have kids singing Christmas carols on a boat

The weather was usually better in Vancouver, which is why it was possible to send a boatload of kids out into Vancouver Harbour to sing Christmas carols in December.
By 1980, the tradition had been going on for 20 years, though The National still had to explain its provenance to its viewers.
"The spirit of Christmas spreads across the city from the ocean from the voices of hundreds of children aboard an old ferry boat," the CBC's Peter Mansbridge told viewers on Dec. 21, 1980.
"When it all started in 1960, there were only eight children. Now there are as many as the boat can safely hold."
The National deemed the tradition "unique," with Mansbridge describing the other parts of the occasion that made it special.
"As it makes its way around Vancouver Harbour, it's often accompanied by other boats decked in Christmas lights," he said.
Viewers at home saw visuals of boats draped with Christmas lights — the kind that would otherwise be hung on suburban garages — following the caroling kids on their journey around the harbour.
The visuals were very dramatic, with the bright lights sharply illuminated against the dark night sky, as viewers at home and on the shore of the Vancouver Harbour heard the children singing Christmas carols, accompanied by a piano.
