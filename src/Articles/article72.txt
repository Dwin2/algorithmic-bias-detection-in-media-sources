After a loss to Croatia on Sunday, Canada's men's soccer team will not qualify for the next round of competition at the World Cup in Qatar. But they've got one more chance to score on Thursday, when they're scheduled to play a match against Morocco.

The team already made history by scoring a single goal against Croatia — Canada's first in a men's World Cup tournament. It's a better result than the team's previous appearance in the World Cup tournament in 1986, when they scored zero goals in three games. 
It had been almost nine months since the team won the match in St. John's that clinched their spot in the World Cup. With the event set to begin the following day, CBC's The Journal aired reporter Jerry Thompson's documentary, Team Hopeful, on May 30, 1986.
