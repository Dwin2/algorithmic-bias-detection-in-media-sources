A year that was as tough for Santa Claus as it was for everyone

How could St. Nick have trouble finding work during the Christmas season?
Well, a recession could make that happen, as it did in 1991.
That December, reporter Saša Petricic looked at the reasons why Santa Claus was making fewer appearances at the mall, in stores and company parties ahead of Christmas.
"The man in red [is] a victim of businesses in the red," Petricic told viewers, in a report that The National aired just ahead of Christmas that year.
That meant Brian Wenham, a popular seasonal performer, was spending a lot less time dressed up as Santa at Winnipeg-area malls than he normally would.
"His bookings are down by almost a half — all because companies are less profitable, mind you, not because he's any less popular," Petricic explained, as viewers saw images of Wenham waving to children eager to see Santa dropping by.
Wenham believed more merry times would be seen in future.
"Maybe times will get better and then there'll be more Santas out there," he said.
Still, Petricic bluntly summed up the less-than-jolly holiday season for viewers at home: "It's not the Grinch who stole Santa, it's the recession."
