When a recession left fewer people flying home for the holidays

Fewer people were flying home for Christmas, and it wasn't by choice.
In 1982, a recession left a lot of Canadians looking for ways to cut costs during the holiday season — and that included money spent on transportation.
"Airlines do not expect a bonanza this Christmas," Michael McIvor reported on The National on Dec. 9, 1982.
"Fewer people will be travelling and many who do will be going as cheaply as possible — even if it means taking a transcontinental bus or train."
One repercussion of this trend was that train tickets, in turn, were becoming harder to come by.
"If you do plan to reserve a seat on Via Rail for Christmas travel, then do it now," McIvor warned viewers who might be procrastinating.
"Some trains are already 90 per cent booked."
Bus operators were also expecting a lot more people on board than usual.
McIvor said airlines were already observing a decrease in Christmas bookings ahead of the holiday.
"What we're noticing during this Christmas period is really what we've noticed in the airline throughout the entire year," said public affairs spokesman Brock Stewart, describing the challenges The National had been following.
"Loads are down and this has continued into Christmas and is reflected in the demand for seats during the Christmas period."
McIvor said Air Canada would provide fewer extra flights for Christmas than usual, though it still had seats available. He said CP Air did not intend to add any extra flights.
